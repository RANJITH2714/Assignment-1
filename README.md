# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Finder

## Overview
This repository contains a Python program that helps users find near misses for Fermat's Last Theorem in the form of the equation \(x^n + y^n = z^n\). The program takes user inputs for the values of \(n\) and \(k\) and computes the smallest relative miss for the given range of values.

## Files
- `NearMiss.py`: The Python script that contains the implementation of the near misses finder.
- `NearMiss.exe`: An executable version of the Python script for ease of use.

## Description
The program allows the user to input two integers \(n\) and \(k\) with the following constraints:
- \(2 < n < 12\)
- \(k \geq 10\)

It will then find positive integers \(x\) and \(y\) within the specified range and compute the smallest relative difference (miss) between the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation \(x^n + y^n = z^n\).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended).
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python NearMiss.py
   ```
4. Or directly click on the exe file.
